Welcome to my web page! 

I hold a MA in International Strategic Studies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and a BA in International Relations from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), both in Brazil. I have a background in International Relations and Comparative Politics, with a focus on Latin America. My main research interests are War and Change in IR Theory, Regional Orders, International Hierarchies and Historical Sociology.
