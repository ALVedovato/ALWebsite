I'm an incoming Political Science Ph.D. student at Northwestern University. I hold an M.A. in International Strategic Studies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br/)) and a B.A. in International Relations from the Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br/)), both in Brazil. 

Currently, I'm also a Research Fellow at the [Research Group on State Capacity, Security and Defense](http://ufsm.br/gecap) - [GECAP/CNPq](http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/6450070412019030). I have a background in International Relations & Comparative Politics, with a focus on Latin America. My work is focused on the relationship between conflict and state development, and I have spent the last years studying the historical and long-term effects of war on Latin American state and regional formation. My main research interests also include: State Capacity, Historical Sociology, Regional Orders & Hierarchies, International Systems, War and Change in IR Theory, and Methods (mainly Process Tracing, QCA and Network Analysis).
 
In Northwestern, beyond my academic training in the Political Science department, I'll be also joining the [Comparative-Historical Social Science (CHSS)](https://buffett.northwestern.edu/programs/chss/index.html) cluster and participating in activities at the [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/about/).
