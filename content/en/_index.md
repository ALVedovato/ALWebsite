I'm a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University. I hold an M.A. in International Strategic Studies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br/)) and a B.A. in International Relations from the Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br/)), both in Brazil. 

I have a background in International Relations & Comparative Politics, with a focus on Latin America. I study the relationship between conflict and international order, and I have spent the last years studying the historical and long-term effects of war on Latin American state and regional formation. My current project is focused on 19th century Latin America and the emergence of international norms of sovereignty recognition. My main research interests  include: Historical IR, Historical Sociology, Regional Orders & Hierarchies, International Systems, War and Change in IR Theory, State Formation, State Capacity, and Methods (mainly Comparative Historical Methods, QCA, and Network Analysis).
 
Beyond my academic training in the Political Science department, I'm also part of the [Comparative-Historical Social Science (CHSS)](https://buffett.northwestern.edu/programs/chss/index.html) and the [Latin American & Caribbean Studies (LACS)](https://lacs.northwestern.edu/graduate) clusters in Northwestern. I'm also a Research Fellow at the [Research Group on State Capacity, Security and Defense](http://ufsm.br/gecap) - [GECAP/CNPq](http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/6450070412019030).
