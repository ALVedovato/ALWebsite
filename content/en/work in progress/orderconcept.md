**Abstract**: The article presents a concept analysis of a fundamental element of the international system, the international order. We investigate the connotative definition given to the concept by a relevant literature in the International Relations field and we discuss what such definition represents for the metatheoretical image of the discipline. Our argument is that there is a multiplicity of multi-dimensional definitions of international order and the degree of similarity from each conceptual connotation reveals theoretical communities that do not fit the usual metatheoretical narratives of IR. These conceptual clusters are organized in a different and more fluid frame vis a vis the theoretical communities that often appear in IR traditional theoretical assessments, such as the Great Debates or Scientific Research Programs.
