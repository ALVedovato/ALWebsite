**Abstract**: This paper aims to analyze the role of Liberian women in the Liberian War and in the beginning of the peacebuilding process in the country. In light of the experiences of women during the war and their traditional gender roles, women's political agency manifested itself by the peace process organization, demonstrating the possibilities of contestation and claims from the organized female society in this scenario. Therewith, we seek to debate why women played a leading political role in the Liberian War and peacebuilding process. Firstly, we discuss gender in political and security dynamics, analyzing the role of women in the conflict and in the reconstruction of the state. Then, considering the role of women, the main dynamics of the Liberian war are reviewed. The third section deals with women's participation in peace processes, especially in the early period of peacebuilding, considering the peace operation in Liberia. Through a case study, we argue that the leading role played by women in the conflict settling and in the beginning of the peace process in Liberia manifests itself in the context of a historical societal organization around solidarity between women, strengthened by the traditional African matriarchal organization. It is presented that several groups of women were successful in demonstrations for the end of the conflict and subsequently participated effectively in the peacebuilding process, strengthening the role of women in Liberian society and enabling the transition to a new political moment in the country.
