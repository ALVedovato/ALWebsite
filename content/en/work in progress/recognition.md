title: "Fighting for Recognition: the International Dimension of Latin American Wars of Independence"
---
 
**Abstract**: This paper explores the relationship between wars of independence and international order. Focusing on 19th century Latin America, I analyze the role of war on independence movements, and how the quest for sovereignty and external recognition was considered and mobilized by independence leaders and society. I argue that war was a mechanism to achieve independence, fight for rights, and guarantee sovereignty status for independent states as members of the international system. Departing from the international order and state formation literature, I show how Latin American regional and local conflicts also have an international dimension and were historically connected with international order projects. The case illustrates how war is an ordering mechanism even in cases/regions where it would not be “expected” to be, and how international order historically favors conflict as a mechanism of integration in the international system. My work also contributes to a broader exploration of how order influences local, regional, and global patterns of conflict, as well as the role that regional and local conflicts have played in international order projects over time.
