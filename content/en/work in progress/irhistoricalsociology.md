**Abstract**: This paper discusses how Historical Sociology can, along with traditional IR Theory, bring new contributions for the debate about continuity and change in the international system. Focusing on war, order formation and structural change, it examines some intersections between Historical Sociology and IR theory on these themes. Firstly, contrary to the literature that frames Historical Sociology as epistemologically associated with neorealist approaches, I argue that due to its focus on war as catalyst for structural transformation, Historical Sociology is more close to Structural Change Approaches (e.g., the Power Transition Theory and Hegemonic Stability Theory) than to neorealism. While more traditional realist approaches focus on stability and emphasize the structural anarchical character of the international order, Structural Change Approaches focus on change, analyzing the formation, transformation, and rupture of international systems. Secondly, Historical Sociology provides a theoretical-methodological framework that values and supports the observation of macrohistorical and temporal-spatial specificities that are crucial to understanding long-term structural processes of continuity and change. In conclusion, the paper shows that together, these perspectives provide an adequate framework for assessing how international systems are formed and how they maintain or change through violent processes, shaping both structural and unit-level systemic dimensions.
