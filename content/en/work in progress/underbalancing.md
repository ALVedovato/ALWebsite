**Abstract**: This article proposes a neoclassical realist approach to the foreign policies of Argentina and Brazil from 1964 to 2014. Although realist approaches to the history of foreign relations of these countries have been little explored, we show that two factors in particular – i.e. (i) differences in relative power (material capabilities), and (ii) key domestic variables such as social fragmentation, regime vulnerability, and elite fragmentation – go to great lengths in explaining Argentina’s foreign policy behavior to Brazil, and Brazil’s own strategic positioning toward the United States. In concrete terms, we analyze the evolution of domestic conditions and foreign policy outcomes during that 50-year period in light of a theory of ‘underbalancing.’ Our conclusions demonstrate that Argentina’s attempts to counterbalance the ascension of Brazil, as well as Brazil’s attempt to play a more prominent global role leading South America as a regional power and soft balancing the Unites States, can be explained by the interaction of those systemic and domestic variables.
