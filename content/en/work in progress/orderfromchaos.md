title: "Building Order from Chaos: war and regional order in Latin America"

**Abstract**: This paper discusses how the sequences, critical junctures, and outcomes of some wars were decisive for the regional order configuration in Latin America since the independence period. The main argument is that war defines (I) the relevant units in the regions, (II) the distribution of power among them, and, collectively, (III) the degree of autonomy that regions have in relation to the international system. In Latin America, war was instrumental in defining the contemporary regional order following a historical path consistent with our argument. Wars between 1800 and 1859 forged the main political units of the region. The regionâ€™s distribution of power was also defined through wars that occurred between 1860 and 1939. Finally, the global conflicts between 1940 and 2000 (World War and Cold War events) reiterated the limits of regional autonomy in Latin America. Based on the critical analysis of Historical Sociology, Power Transition and Hegemonic Stability theories, the integration of levels of analysis and the reinterpretation of historical events, we intend to rescue the contingent character of conflictive interactions to demonstrate that war outcomes matter to understand structural change and order formation in the region.
