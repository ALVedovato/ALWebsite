**Abstract**: Which elements explain the relationship between status-seeking strategies and foreign policy outcomes? Basic principles of foreign policy making consider status and relative position in the international system as core elements to strategic planning. On the other hand, status literature argue that autonomous foreign policies are usually a determinant of status attribution, which suggests a co-constitution. However, it is still unclear how status-seeking strategies affect foreign policy outcomes. Naturally, status-seeking strategies are costly projects: they require strategic planning, alliances reconfiguration and willingness to de ploy capabilities to achieve policy goals, yet they also entail a less discussed asset: autonomy. The trap here is that more autonomous projects are also costly because they challenge status quo, making high status position more difficult to achieve. Following neoclassical realism prepositions and based on previous QCA findings from our project on foreign policy change in Latin America, we argue that two sets of conditions explain status positioning: i. systemic constraints (distribution of power and material capabilities); and ii. domestic pressures (regime stability, elite behavior, and social cohesion). Our cases show that in order to achieve status attribution, states following international status-seeking strategies compromise autonomous foreign policy goals (i.e., Brazil and Chile), while states with more autonomous foreign policy struggle to move on the ranks of status attribution (i.e., Argentina and Venezuela). Our findings underline the limits of autonomous agency attached with status-seeking strategies and the role played by regional organizations in trying to avoid the trap.
